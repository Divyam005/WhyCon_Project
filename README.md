# WhyCon based localization system 
This is the repository for a winter project.
To use the files:
1) Make `whycon_catkin_ws` as your current directory. Build the workspace using `$ catkin_make`.
2) Make sure that your camera is calibrated. The tutorial for monocular camera calibration can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration).
3) Use `$ roslaunch localization.launch` to launch the WhyCon tracking window. 

Several parameters can be tweaked in the localization.launch file in the workspace.
